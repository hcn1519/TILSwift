### Loop Through Multiple Arrays Simultaneously

Use `zip` to do this.

```swift
let arr1 = ["hello", "world", "it", "is", "swift"]
let arr2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

// zip Method: zip(sequence1: Sequence, sequence2: Sequence)
for (str, num) in zip(arr1, arr2) {
    print("\(num): \(str)")
}
```

When looping through different lengths of sequences together, the loop is terminated based on a short-length array.

```swift
let arr1 = ["hello", "world", "it", "is", "swift"]
let dict1: [String: Int] = ["Hello": 0, "Swift": 1]

for (str, (key: key, value: value)) in zip(arr1, dict1) {
    print("\(str): \(value) - \(key)")
}
```

If you want to loop through triple or more? Do it like this. ðŸ˜€

```swift
let arr1 = ["hello", "world", "it", "is", "swift"]
let arr2 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
let arr3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

for (label, (str, num)) in zip(arr3, (zip(arr1, arr2))) {
    print("\(label), \(num): \(str)")
}
```

### Set Custom Decoder

Sometimes we need to initialize struct which conforms `Codable` protocol in different ways when initializing it.

For example, your struct has 'Bool' type property, but your server API send that property with `Int` type. In this case, if your job is only for `decode` it does not matters. However if you try to `encode` that property to `Bool` type, you will get in trouble. To resolve this kind of situation, you can give your `CodingUserInfo` to your `decoder` and initialize both cases.

1. Give your `decoder` some `userInfo` whatever you want.

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
if let userInfoKey = CodingUserInfoKey(rawValue: "type") {
    let codingUserInfo: [CodingUserInfoKey: Any] = [userInfoKey: "decodeJson"]
    decoder.userInfo = codingUserInfo
}
```

2. Use `userInfo` from `init(from decoder: Decoder)`

```swift
struct Computer: Codable {
  let isRunnig: Bool

  enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
      case isRunnig = "isRunnig"
  }
}
extension Computer {
  init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
      let codingKey = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)

      let isRunning: Bool = try {
        if let userInfo = decoder.userInfo[CodingUserInfoKey(rawValue: "type")!] as? String {
          if userInfo == "decodeJson" {
              let isRunningValue = try codingKey.decode(Int.self, forKey: .isRunnig)
              return isRunningValue == 1 ? true : false
          } else {
              return try codingKey.decode(Bool.self, forKey: .complete)
          }
        }
        return false
      }()
  }
}
```

### Nested Enum

You can use nested enum for complex situation. Here is an example. You have an edior for writing texts or uploading images. You want to set `ContentState` of editor using enum. So your first approach will be like this.

```swift
class Editor {
  enum ContentState {
    case writingText, settingImage
  }

  var contentState: ContentState
}
```

After few weeks later, You have received a proposal for an editor with a new feature. For example, your editor only had Adding feature, but now it can edit or delete text. You need to upgrade image feature also. So, In this case `ContentState` can have nested enum like this.

```swift
enum ContentState {
    enum TextType {
        case addText, editText, deleteText
    }
    enum ImageType {
        case addImage, editImage, deleteImage
    }
    case text(TextType)
    case image(ImageType)
    case none
}
```
In this case you can set your `contentState` property like this.

```swift
self.contentState = ContentState.image(.addImage)
```

And enum with `switch`,

```swift
switch contentState {
  case .text(.editText):
    break
  case .image(.setActorImage):
    break
  case .image(.setBackgroundImage):
    break
  case .image(.setMessageImage):
  default:
    break
}
```
